        <p>As a huge fan of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Sanderson" target="_blank">Brandon Sanderson</a>, I’ve been captivated by the incredible world of The Stormlight Archive.

      <h2>Wit</h2>
      <p>Wit is a mysterious and eccentric wanderer with an uncanny knack for being in the right place at the right time. Often speaking in riddles and seemingly nonsensical remarks, he hides a sharp mind beneath his playful demeanor. There’s more to him than meets the eye, and those who dismiss him as a mere fool may find themselves gravely mistaken.</p>
